# go_rpi
Rebooting of experiments, libraries, and tools for working with a Raspberry Pi. 

## Installation
`go get -d -u github.com/wickerdj/go_rpi`

If the above throws an error, remove the switches -d and -u and try again. The new command would be `go get github.com/wickerdj/go_rpi`. Double check that files were downloaded.
